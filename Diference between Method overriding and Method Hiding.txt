Difference between Method overriding and Method Hiding in C#:

Method Overrding: 
Method Overriding is a technique that allows the invoking of functions from another class (base class) in the derived class. 
It creates a method in the derived class with the same signature as a method in the base class.
In Method overriding, when base class reference variable pointing to the object of the derived class, then it will call the overridden method in the derived class.


Method hiding:
You can hide the implementation of the methods of a base class from the derived class using the new keyword. In the other
words, you can redefine the method of the base class in the derived class by using the new keyword.
In the method hiding, when base class reference variable pointing to the object of the derived class, then it will call the hidden method in the base class.
